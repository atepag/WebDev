Use npm start once you have react set up.

Main apis used were 
GOOGLE MAPS(react package react-google-maps),
ESRI COVID_19 api(https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/bbb2e4f589ba40d692fab712ae37b9ac?showData=true),
Rapid api COVID_19 DATA BY GRAMZIVI(https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data/details)

the map is a world map with a world count of cases as well as aditional information per region. Each marker can be clicked to show information about the cases and numbers. The spread is shown by the coronavirus red logo, bigger markers mean bigger spread while small ones are few spread.
Please reach out to me if you have any questions. This was my first time using react, I wanted to challenge myself so I tried my best yet it might look confusing, so I will gladly clarify if needed.
