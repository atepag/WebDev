Used bootstrap library to split screen in two halves at the home scree.
Animations were used creating Keyframes and media.
The entire website was creating using html and css objects found on w3schools. 
Fixing the position of the objects was hard as to I had not played with them before,
I did my best to make it relative to the window size, yet I could not figure out, how to change
dimensions when a smaller screen is being used.
